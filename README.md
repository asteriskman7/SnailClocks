# SnailClocks
Collection of all the snail clocks I have created.

Starting on Friday, July 27, 2018 and for a total of 12 consecutive Fridays, I created various types of clocks that are snail themed in some way.

# Hilbert Snail Clock
The snail traces out the path of a [hilbert curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve) over the course of an hour. The highlighted bulge traverses the current path once per minute.

# Snail Shell Clock
The current time winds its way up from the center of the snail's shell following a [logarithmic spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_spiral). The center of the spiral is infinitely distant in the future.

# Snail Slime Clock
A single snail goes from one point on the edge of a circle to another point on the edge of a circle, leaving a [slimy trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snail_slime) behind it. It chooses its path such that, over time, it draws the current time.

# Snail Walk Clock
A single snail [walks](https://www.britannica.com/animal/gastropod/Locomotion) around the clock face leaving a multicolored trail in its wake. It fills in the clock so that what it leaves slime-free is the current time. If it gets stuck too long in its own trail it takes a big leap towards the center in the hope that it will find a clean area that needs filled.

# Parallax Snail Clock
A snail travels along the ground on a path where the current time enters the picture just as the minute changes. The background simulates depth by faking [parallax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax). The hight of the hills and mountains and the color of the grass are controlled by a type of [Perlin noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise).

# Snail Destination Clock
An [escargatoire of snails](https://researchmaniacs.com/CollectiveNouns/Animals/What-is-a-group-of-Snails-called.html) come together in the middle of a field to create the digits of the current time. Unfortunately, a hungry bird comes by and catches them off guard.

# Falling Shells Clock
Many snail shells (each, one of two colors) are dropped from above and fall down through a [Plinko](http://priceisright.wikia.com/wiki/Plinko) style board. When they come to rest, their final arangement shows the current time. [MAGIC!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(illusion)) (The secret is to run the simulation once while not displaying it to find the final position of the shells, decide their colors, and then run the identical sim again with the calculated colors.)


# Hypnosnails Clock
The eyes of two hypnosnails will take over your mind while displaying the time. Every digit is made from many connected points that create the digit outline. Over time, those points are [morphed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphing) from their position in the previous time's digit to their position in the next time's digit. The morphing has some [Perlin noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise) applied to keep your mind open to suggestion.
